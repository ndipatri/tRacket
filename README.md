# tRacket


## tRacket is a mobile network-enabled device meant to be installed at a tennis court so you can know when a court is available by looking at a Twitter feed.

This outer project also involves a Kotlin Multi Platform (KMP) solution to provide mobile code for both iOS and Android.  I've recently decided that using Twitter to access live tRacket information is better.. So most of my work now on this project is inside of this subdirectory of this Github Project:
